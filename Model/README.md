# MRCL-ELM: A Hybrid Model Architecture for Satellite Image Classification

## Overview

This repository presents a novel hybrid deep learning model combining **EfficientNet-B0**, **residual refinement blocks**, **multi-level feature fusion**, **LSTM**, and **Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)** for land use/land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with efficient training and inference.
